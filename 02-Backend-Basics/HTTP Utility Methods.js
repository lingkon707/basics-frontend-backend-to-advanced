HTTP utility methods in Express.js are a set of functions that correspond to the standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.). These methods are provided by the Express application object (`app`) to define routes for handling specific types of HTTP requests. Here's an overview of these utility methods:

1. **`app.get(path, callback [, callback ...])`:**
   - Handles GET requests for the specified path. The callback function(s) are executed when a GET request is made to the specified route.

2. **`app.post(path, callback [, callback ...])`:**
   - Handles POST requests for the specified path. The callback function(s) are executed when a POST request is made to the specified route.

3. **`app.put(path, callback [, callback ...])`:**
   - Handles PUT requests for the specified path. The callback function(s) are executed when a PUT request is made to the specified route.

4. **`app.delete(path, callback [, callback ...])`:**
   - Handles DELETE requests for the specified path. The callback function(s) are executed when a DELETE request is made to the specified route.

5. **`app.all(path, callback [, callback ...])`:**
   - Handles all HTTP methods for the specified path. The callback function(s) are executed regardless of the HTTP method used in the request.

6. **`app.use([path,] callback [, callback ...])`:**
   - Mounts middleware functions at the specified path. If no path is specified, the middleware is executed for all requests. This method is often used for setting up middleware that needs to be executed for every request.

7. **`app.route(path)`:**
   - Returns an instance of a single route, which can be chained with HTTP methods to handle different request methods on the same path. This method is useful for organizing route-related code.

These utility methods provide a clean and expressive way to define routes and handle different types of HTTP requests in your Express application. For example:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

// Handling GET requests
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello, GET request!');
});

// Handling POST requests
app.post('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello, POST request!');
});

// Handling multiple HTTP methods for a path
app.all('/api/data', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Handling all HTTP methods for /api/data');
});

// Using app.route() to handle multiple HTTP methods on the same path
app.route('/users')
  .get((req, res) => {
    res.send('Get a list of users');
  })
  .post((req, res) => {
    res.send('Add a new user');
  });

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server is running on port 3000');
});
```

These examples showcase how the HTTP utility methods in Express.js can be employed to handle various types of HTTP requests and define routes in a concise and readable manner.
