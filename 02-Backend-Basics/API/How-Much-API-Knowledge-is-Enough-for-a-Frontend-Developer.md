# How Much API Knowledge is Enough for a Frontend Developer

## 1. Core Knowledge You Must Have
- **HTTP Basics**
  - GET, POST, PUT/PATCH, DELETE
- **Async Handling**
  - Promises, async/await
- **Fetching Data**
  - Using Fetch API or Axios
- **Error Handling**
  - Handling 4xx/5xx errors gracefully
  - Showing loading states or fallback UI
- **Working with JSON**
  - Parsing JSON, accessing nested data
- **API Docs**
  - Knowing how to read endpoints, query params, headers
- **Optional Chaining**
  - Avoid runtime errors with `data?.property`

---

## 2. What You Don’t Need Initially
- Deep knowledge of backend implementation
- Writing complex server logic
- Authentication methods beyond basic token/header usage
- Advanced caching or performance optimization on API level

---

## 3. Practical Skill Checklist
- ✅ Can fetch and display data from an API
- ✅ Can send data to backend via POST/PUT
- ✅ Can handle loading, errors, empty states in UI
- ✅ Can read API docs and implement endpoints
- ✅ Can debug common API issues (CORS, network errors, wrong response)
- ✅ Knows difference between SSR/SSG and when API is called

---

## 4. Survival Advice
- Focus on **API as a data source**, not backend internals
- Debug systematically: test endpoint first, then connect to frontend
- Centralize API calls for easier maintenance
- Learn **one tool well**: Axios or Fetch
- You don’t need 100% mastery — **80% practical knowledge is enough** to start and grow on the job

---

## 5. Mindset
- Treat APIs as a **black box** that returns data
- Your job: **display, send, handle errors, and debug**
- On-job learning will fill gaps as needed
