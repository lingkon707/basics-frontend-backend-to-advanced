Express.js is a popular web application framework for Node.js. It provides a minimal and flexible set of features for building web and mobile applications. Here are some important features of Express.js:

1. **Middleware:**
   - Express.js uses middleware functions to perform various tasks in the request-response cycle. Middleware can handle tasks such as authentication, logging, parsing request bodies, and more.

2. **Routing:**
   - Express provides a simple and effective way to define routes for handling HTTP requests. Routes are used to map URLs to specific controllers or handlers.

3. **HTTP Utility Methods:**
   - Express simplifies the handling of HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) through methods like `app.get()`, `app.post()`, `app.put()`, and `app.delete()`.

4. **Template Engines:**
   - While not included in its core, Express easily integrates with various template engines (such as EJS, Pug, or Handlebars) to facilitate server-side rendering of dynamic content.

5. **Middleware for Error Handling:**
   - Express has middleware specifically designed for handling errors. This makes it easy to centralize error handling logic in one place.

6. **Static File Serving:**
   - Express can serve static files, making it convenient for serving images, stylesheets, and client-side JavaScript files.

7. **RESTful API Development:**
   - Express is commonly used for building RESTful APIs. Its simplicity and flexibility make it well-suited for creating endpoints that adhere to REST principles.

8. **Request and Response Objects:**
   - Express extends Node.js's `request` and `response` objects, providing additional functionality and making it easier to work with HTTP requests and responses.

9. **Middleware Execution Order:**
   - Express allows developers to control the order in which middleware functions are executed, providing flexibility in handling requests.

10. **View and Session Support:**
    - While Express itself is minimalist, it allows easy integration with various view engines and supports session management through middleware.

11. **Ecosystem and Middleware:**
    - Express has a vast ecosystem of middleware modules that can be easily integrated for additional functionality, such as authentication, compression, and logging.

12. **Flexible Configuration:**
    - Express allows developers to configure the application according to their needs. It is unopinionated, meaning it doesn't enforce a rigid structure, giving developers the freedom to organize their code.

13. **Community and Documentation:**
    - Express has a large and active community, which means extensive documentation, tutorials, and support are available. This makes it easier for developers to find solutions to common issues.

Express.js is widely used for its simplicity, flexibility, and ease of use, making it a go-to choice for many Node.js developers when building web applications and APIs.
