| Folder Name Pattern | Pros                                   | Cons                              |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| `[school]/[class]`  | Semantic, readable, easy to understand | Longer folder names               |
| `[slug]/[slug]`     | Generic, can use for unknown paths     | Confusing, you must parse meaning |
| `[class]/[student]` | Semantic for class â†’ student URLs      | Must plan hierarchy carefully     |


TL;DR

Use descriptive names ([school], [class], [student]) for nested dynamic routes.
Use [slug] only for generic unknown segments.
Naming segments semantically improves readability, maintainability, and debugging.
