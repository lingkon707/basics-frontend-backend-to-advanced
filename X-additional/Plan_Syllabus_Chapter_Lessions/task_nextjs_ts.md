# Frontend Website Development Tasks: TypeScript vs Next.js

In a modern frontend web application, **TypeScript** and **Next.js** play different but complementary roles.  
This file explains **which parts** are handled by TypeScript and Next.js, along with their typical tasks.

---

## 1. TypeScript (TS)

TypeScript is a **superset of JavaScript** that adds **static typing** and improves developer productivity.  
It mainly focuses on **code safety, type definitions, and maintainability**.

### **Tasks for TypeScript**
- **Type Safety**
  - Define types/interfaces for props, states, API responses
  - Use enums, unions, generics for data modeling
- **Form Handling**
  - Strongly typed form inputs and validation rules
- **API Integration**
  - Type responses from REST APIs / GraphQL
  - Prevent runtime errors by checking request/response structure
- **State Management**
  - Strongly typed global state (Redux, Zustand, Context API)
- **Reusable Components**
  - Define prop types for React components
  - Create reusable utility functions with type safety
- **Error Prevention**
  - Catch errors at compile time instead of runtime
- **Code Documentation**
  - Self-documenting code via types

✅ Example:  
- Ensuring `user.id` is always a number, not accidentally a string  
- Preventing a function from receiving `null` when it expects an object

## 2. Next.js

Next.js is a **React framework** that provides **server-side rendering, routing, and performance optimizations**.  
It focuses on **application architecture, rendering strategy, and data fetching**.

### **Tasks for Next.js**
- **Routing**
  - File-based routing (pages or app router)
  - Dynamic routes (`/products/[id]`)
  - Nested layouts
- **Rendering Strategies**
  - Server-Side Rendering (SSR)
  - Static Site Generation (SSG)
  - Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)
  - Client-Side Rendering (CSR when needed)
- **API Routes**
  - Create backend endpoints inside `/api`
- **Data Fetching**
  - `getStaticProps`, `getServerSideProps` (Pages router)
  - `fetch` with caching strategies (App router)
- **SEO**
  - Meta tags, Open Graph, structured data
  - Dynamic `head` components
- **Performance**
  - Image optimization (`next/image`)
  - Font optimization (`next/font`)
  - Code splitting and prefetching
- **Deployment**
  - Works out-of-the-box on Vercel
  - Handles build-time optimizations

✅ Example:  
- Generating product detail pages statically at build time  
- Serving optimized images with lazy loading

## 3. How They Work Together

- **TypeScript** ensures code is **safe, predictable, and maintainable**.  
- **Next.js** ensures the app is **fast, SEO-friendly, and scalable**.  

### **Workflow**
1. Define **types/interfaces** in TypeScript for products, users, forms, etc.  
2. Use **Next.js routing and data fetching** to generate pages dynamically.  
3. Combine both:  
   - Next.js fetches product data → TypeScript ensures the fetched data matches expected types.  
   - Next.js builds pages with SSR/SSG → TypeScript enforces component props and API responses.
