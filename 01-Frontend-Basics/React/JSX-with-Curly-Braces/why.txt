Sometimes you will want to add a little JavaScript logic or reference a dynamic
 property inside that markup. In this situation, you can use curly braces in 
 your JSX to open a window to JavaScript.

 ## Where to use curly braces 
 You can only use curly braces in two ways inside JSX:

1. As text directly inside a JSX tag: 
<h1>{name}'s To Do List</h1> works, but <{tag}>Gregorio Y. Zara's To Do List</{tag}> will not.

2. As attributes immediately following the = sign: src={avatar} will read the avatar variable, but src="{avatar}" will pass the string "{avatar}".
