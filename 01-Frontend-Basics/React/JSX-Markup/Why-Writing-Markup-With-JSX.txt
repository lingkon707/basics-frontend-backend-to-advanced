JSX: Putting markup into JavaScript 
The Web has been built on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. For many years, 
web developers kept content in HTML, design in CSS, and logic in JavaScript—
often in separate files! 

Content was marked up inside HTML 
while the page’s logic lived separately in JavaScript:
index.html and main.js

** Solutions
But as the Web became more interactive, logic increasingly determined content. 
JavaScript was in charge of the HTML! This is why in React, 
rendering logic and markup live together in the same place—components.
