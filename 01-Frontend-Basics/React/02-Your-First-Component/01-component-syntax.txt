Step 1: Export the component 
The export default prefix is a standard JavaScript syntax (not specific to React). It lets you mark the main function in a file so that you can later import it from other files.
(More on importing in Importing and Exporting Components!)

Step 2: Define the function 
With function Profile() { } you define a JavaScript function with the name Profile.

React components are regular JavaScript functions, 
but their names must start with a Capital Letter or they wonâ€™t work!
