# Perfect Time to Use Server-Side Rendering (SSR)

## Key Idea
SSR generates the page **on the server for every request**, so it is ideal when you need **fresh, dynamic, or personalized content**.

---

## Best Use Cases for SSR

1. **Dynamic Content**
   - Pages that update frequently.
   - Example: News websites, social media feeds, e-commerce product listings.

2. **Personalized Content**
   - When content depends on the user.
   - Example: User dashboards, account pages, recommendation feeds.

3. **SEO-Critical Pages**
   - When search engines must index the latest content.
   - Example: Blog homepages, landing pages with dynamic updates.

4. **Real-Time Data**
   - When data changes often and must be current.
   - Example: Stock prices, live sports scores, chat messages.

## When NOT to Use SSR
- Pages with content that rarely changes → better use **SSG** (Static Site Generation) for speed.
- Pages that do not need SEO or real-time updates → client-side rendering is enough.

## Summary
Use SSR when:
- Fresh, up-to-date content is essential.
- Content is personalized per user.
- SEO for dynamic pages matters.
