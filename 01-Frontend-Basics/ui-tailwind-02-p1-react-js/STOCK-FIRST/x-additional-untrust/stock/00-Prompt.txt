I am uploading a PNG file that shows a UI design. 
Please analyze this design thoroughly — layout, color scheme, spacing, typography, and interaction flow. 
Then, recreate the same design using high-quality, professional standards as if you were a senior Google UI/UX designer. 
Use React.js for the component structure and Tailwind CSS for styling. 
Ensure the code is clean, responsive, pixel-perfect, and maintainable. 
Use best practices in both UX and accessibility. 
I want this to look production-ready and feel like a Google-level product.
