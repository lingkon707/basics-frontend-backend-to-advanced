Why does the "Previous" button work when you're on the first blog, and the "Next" button still works on the last blog?

ðŸ§  The reason:

Because you're not disabling the buttons when they should be inactive.

Right now, both buttons (onPrev and onNext) always call their respective functions when clicked â€” regardless of whether currentIndex is 0 (first blog) or currentIndex === totalBlogs - 1 (last blog).
âœ… What You Need to Do

Add logic to disable the buttons based on the currentIndex.
